# ðŸ“˜ Multi-Clock Domain RTL-to-GDS

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This project implements a small design with **two clock domains**, focusing on clock domain crossing and timing analysis.

## ðŸ”¹ Objectives
- Design multi-clock system.
- Verify CDC behavior.
- Perform synthesis and backend.
- Analyze multi-clock timing in STA.

## ðŸ”¹ Tools Used
- Yosys
- OpenLANE
- OpenSTA
- PDK: Sky130

## ðŸ”¹ Workflow
1. RTL design with dual clock.  
2. Verification of synchronizers.  
3. Synthesis.  
4. Backend implementation.  
5. STA with multiple clocks.  

## ðŸ”¹ Results
- Successful STA with multi-clock âœ…  
- Layout screenshots âœ…  

## ðŸ”¹ Learnings
- CDC design techniques.  
- Multi-clock STA constraints.  

## ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements
- Add clock gating.  
- Apply advanced CDC checks.
