# RTL_to_GDS_codex

# 🏗️ VLSI Project Portfolio (Open-Source ASIC Flow)

Welcome to my **VLSI Design Portfolio**, where I showcase **RTL-to-GDSII projects** implemented using **open-source EDA tools** like **Yosys, OpenLANE, Magic, OpenSTA, Netgen, and OpenRAM** with the **Sky130 PDK**.  

This portfolio is divided into **Beginner, Mid-Level, and Advanced Projects** to demonstrate progressive learning in **ASIC Design, Digital Logic, and Physical Design**.

## 🔹 Beginner Projects (Getting Started)
1. [**8-bit ALU RTL-to-GDS**](./alu8)  
   → Designed a simple ALU, verified via simulation, and implemented end-to-end in OpenLANE.  

2. [**8-bit Counter with Clock Gating**](./counter8)  
   → Implemented a synchronous counter with clock gating for power optimization.

## 🔸 Mid-Level Projects (Core Digital Designs)
3. [**UART Controller**](./uart)  
   → Implemented a UART TX/RX with baud generator, verified protocol, and synthesized.  

4. [**SPI Protocol Controller**](./spi)  
   → Designed SPI Master-Slave controller and verified data exchange.  

5. [**Digital FIR Filter**](./fir)  
   → DSP project: FIR filter implemented with shift registers & multipliers.  

6. [**RISC-V Core (PicoRV32)**](./picorv32)  
   → Synthesized and implemented the PicoRV32 RISC-V CPU core.  

7. [**Mini SoC (RISC-V + UART/SPI)**](./mini-soc)  
   → Integrated CPU with communication peripheral into a small SoC.

## 🔴 Advanced Projects (Research-Oriented)
8. [**Multi-Clock Domain Design**](./multi-clock)  
   → Demonstrated Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) and STA with multiple clocks.  

9. [**OpenRAM + SRAM Integration**](./sram-integration)  
   → Generated SRAM macros with OpenRAM and integrated into an SoC.  

10. [**DFT with Scan Chain**](./dft-scan)  
    → Implemented scan chain insertion for testability with Fault tool.
